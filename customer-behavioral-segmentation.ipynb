They also have a lower frequency of purchases and lower monetary value, suggesting that they are less engaged and have lower spending compared to other clusters. These customers might represent a less active and less valuable segment.\n\nCluster 1:\n- Recency: 32.35 (lower value)\n- Frequency: 54.54 (medium value)\n- MonetaryValue: 72,555.48 (medium value)\n\nCustomers in this cluster have lower recency values, indicating more recent purchases.

Here are some insights and conclusions we can draw from the data:\n\n1. Retention Rate Variation: The retention rates vary across different periods. Some periods show higher retention rates, while others show lower rates. For example, in 2007-06, the retention rate was 16.09, indicating a relatively higher retention compared to other periods.\n\n2. Overall Retention Trend: Observing the retention rates over time, we can identify certain patterns. The retention rates tend to fluctuate, with periods of higher retention followed by periods of lower retention. This pattern suggests that there might be factors influencing customer retention that change over time.\n\n3. High Retention Peaks: Several time periods stand out with significantly higher retention rates. For example, in 2016-03, the retention rate spiked to 68, indicating exceptionally high customer retention during that period. These peaks might indicate successful strategies or initiatives implemented by the company during those specific timeframes.\n\n4. Low Retention Periods: Similarly, there are periods with notably lower retention rates. For instance, in 2015-09, the retention rate drops to 3.71, suggesting a decline in customer retention. Identifying the causes of these low retention periods can help the company address any issues and implement measures to improve customer retention.\n\n5. Long-Term Retention: The analysis covers a significant duration, from 2007 to 2022. By examining the retention rates over this extended period, it is possible to identify long-term trends and evaluate the effectiveness of customer retention strategies implemented by the company over time.\n\n6. Retention Rate Stability: Some periods exhibit relatively stable retention rates, such as 2021-07 to 2021-09, where the retention rates hover around 5.4. Stable retention rates indicate a consistent level of customer retention during those periods.\n","metadata":{}}]}
